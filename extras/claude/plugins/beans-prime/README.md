# beans-prime

This is a **work in progress** plugin for Claude Code that aims at integrating Beans a little easier with the agent (so the user doesn't have to manually edit their settings file). It's currently not ready for prime time use -- for now, please refer to Beans' main README for instructions on how to set up Beans with Claude Code.
