Add a 't' keyboard shortcut to the TUI that opens a picker to change the selected bean's type.

Should show available types (milestone, epic, bug, feature, task) and update the bean when one is selected.

Note: Type changes may affect valid parent relationships due to the type hierarchy constraints.
