Explore the codebase and create a first collection of unit tests to establish testing patterns and coverage for core functionality. This should include:

- Setting up the test infrastructure
- Identifying key functions and packages to test
- Writing tests for core bean operations (create, list, show, etc.)
- Establishing testing conventions for the project
- Expanding `CLAUDE.md` with instructions for testing (especially using the `--beans-path` flag to point to test data)
