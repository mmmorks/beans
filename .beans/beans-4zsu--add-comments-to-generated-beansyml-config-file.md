Use the yaml.v3 Node API to add helpful comments to the config file generated by `beans init`.

## Context

Currently `beans init` generates a plain YAML config without comments. Adding comments would make the config more self-documenting and help users understand what each option does.

## Implementation

Use `yaml.Node` with `HeadComment`, `LineComment`, and `FootComment` fields to build the config document with embedded comments.

Example output:
```yaml
# Beans configuration
# See: https://github.com/hmans/beans

beans:
    # Directory where bean files are stored
    path: .beans
    # Prefix for bean IDs (e.g., "myproject-abc1")
    prefix: project-name-
    # Length of the random ID suffix
    id_length: 4
    # Default status for new beans
    default_status: todo
    # Default type for new beans
    default_type: task

server:
    # Port for `beans serve` web UI
    port: 8080
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Create a function in `internal/config` that builds a `yaml.Node` tree with comments
- [ ] Update `Config.Save()` to use the new function
- [ ] Add tests for comment generation
