Add `beans next` command to show the single most important bean to work on.

## Behavior

- Returns the highest-priority `todo` bean that is not blocked
- Shows full bean details (like `beans show`)
- If nothing is ready, suggests checking `beans blocked` or `beans list`

## Example

```bash
beans next
# Shows the single most important bean to tackle
```
