Add a 'b' keyboard shortcut to the TUI that opens a picker to add or remove blocking relationships for the selected bean.

## Behavior
- Show a list of other beans that can be added/removed from the blocking list
- Toggle blocking relationships when a bean is selected
- Visual indication of currently blocked beans

This allows managing bean dependencies directly from the TUI.
